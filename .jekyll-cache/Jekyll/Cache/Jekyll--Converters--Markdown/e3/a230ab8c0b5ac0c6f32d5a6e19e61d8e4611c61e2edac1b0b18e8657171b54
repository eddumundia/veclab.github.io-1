<p class="text-justify lead">
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading viral cause of
infant pneumonia and bronchiolitis worldwide. In this  study we
analysed full genomic information of  RSV  strains circulating in  9
households in the Kilifi community, coastal Kenya, during an epidemic
period.
</p>

<p class="text-justify lead">
The study aimed to inform on the transmission and spread
patterns of RSV within households and the Kilifi community in general to
uncover new avenues for infection control . We showed that genome
analysis is a superior tool for tracking the relatedness, evolution,
spread and transmission of RSV infection relative to either partial
genome analysis  or use of case information data alone .

<p class="text-justify lead">
Viruses that were identified from different members of the same household were more
closely related in most  outbreaks supporting the notion that members
commonly acquire RSV infection within their household. This has
implications for future control of RSV and other respiratory infections.
