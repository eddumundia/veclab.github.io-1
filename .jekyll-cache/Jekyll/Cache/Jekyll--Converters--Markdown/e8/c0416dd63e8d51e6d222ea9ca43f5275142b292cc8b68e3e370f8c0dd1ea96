<h6>Timothy Etyang (Dip Clin. Med)</h6>
<p class="text-justify">
I am a clinical officer with a Diploma in Clinical Medicine from the Kenya Medical Training College in Nairobi. I joined KEMRI-Welcome Trust in 2011 after working with the 
KEMRI-University of Washington Programme as a clinical officer. I was involved in several observational studies and clinical trials with HIV/AIDS. I carried out 
clinical follow up of study participants, clinical management of patients and study co-ordination.

Currently I am working  as a clinician within the SPReD study and involved in characterization of transmission pathways of viral respiratory infections in Kilifi.
