Title: Pakistan Cotton Survey 2013, Round 1.2 
doi:10.7910/DVN/QIUHRO

The Pakistan Cotton Survey 2013, Round 1.2 dataset is  sample survey output produced by 
a research study examining the efficiency of markets for cotton seeds in Pakistan 
conducted by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and implemented 
by Innovative Development Studies (IDS). The data was collected from September 2013 to 
November 2013. These data is part of a series of  other Cotton20 survey rounds conducted 
between 2013 -  2015. More information relating to these data and other related 
documentation can be found at https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/QIUHRO

The data was collected was on the input use and pesticide poisoning symptoms up to the first picking of cotton. 
Its purpose was to examine the efficiency of markets for cotton seed in Pakistan with particular 
emphasis on the market for genetically modified cotton seed embodying insect-resistance traits from the soil 
bacterium Bacillus thurigiensis (Bt) that have been conferred through genetic modification. 
Number publications have been published using or citing  these data (see related publication)

Since the data is part of a series of longitudinal surveys, the researchers might combine all the survey 
datasets and perform longitudinal analysis comparing the  insecticide using and resistance, market trends and 
consumer habits over the given period.

I am a post-doctoral research scientist at <a href="http://www.kemri-wellcome.org" target="blank">KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme (KWTRP)</a>, in Kilifi, Kenya. I joined the programme as a project assistant in November 2005 after completion of a BSc (Nursing Sciences) Degree in Moi University. My main roles were to support inpatient surveillance of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Since then I have been involved in a broad range of research activities, including the development of new research protocols and expansion of the inpatient surveillance to include other respiratory pathogens.

<p class="text-justify">
 In 2008, I was awarded a Commonwealth MSc training scholarship, and completed the MSc in Public Health in Developing Countries at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, United Kingdom in October 2009, passing with a distinction. Upon my return, I initiated epidemiological studies to investigate the transmission patterns of a range of respiratory viruses in the community settings. 
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
These studies formed part of my Ph.D training under the supervision of Professors D. James Nokes (affiliated to KWTRP, Kilifi, Kenya and University of Warwick, UK) and Graham F. Medley (University of Warwick, UK). I  successfully defended my  thesis 'Transmission of Respiratory Syncytial Virus in Households: Who Acquires Infection from Whom' at the Open University, UK in August 2013.

<p class="text-justify">
I am  currently interested in unravelling <a href="{{ site.url }}/spred-kenya" >transmission dynamics of a range
of respiratory viruses</a>
in Kenya and identify potential control strategies.
