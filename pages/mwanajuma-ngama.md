I am currently working as a Senior Clinical Officer at KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme in Kilifi. 
I joined the Programme in 1999 as study clinical officer working with Prof Mike English. In 2002 
I started working with Prof James Nokes in the same capacity looking at pediatric inpatient 
respiratory viruses and later enteric viruses.

<p class="text-justify">
Over time, I gained interest in disease epidemiology and in 2009, 
I graduated with a higher national diploma in epidemiology from Kenya 
Medical Training College- Nairobi and later Post Graduate Diploma and  
Msc in Public health from London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in 2013.

<p class="text-justify">
My current responsibilities involve coordinating the in-patient 
respiratory and enteric viruses surveillances in the wards as well 
as clinical management of study participants.
