<h6>Tom Yates (BSc MSc MBBS DipHIVMan(SA))</h6>


<p class="text-justify">
I am a visiting scientist at the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme. My research in Kilifi attempts to estimate the proportion of pneumonia attributable to specific respiratory viruses. I am using data on cases of severe and very severe pneumonia from Kilifi County Hospital and healthy controls from Patrick Munywoki's household study.

I hold a BSc in Immunology and Cellular Pathology from University College London, a medical degree from UCL Medical School, an MSc in Epidemiology from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a Diploma in HIV Management from the College of Family Physicians of South Africa. My doctoral research was supervised by Ibrahim Abubakar (UCL) and Frank Tanser (University of KwaZulu-Natal) and funded by the UK Medical Research Council, K-RITH and the UCL Grand Challenges Small Grant Scheme. This research focused on risk factors for and the spatial patterning of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in rural South Africa. I submitted my PhD thesis in March 2016.

Prior to joining the Virus Epidemiology and Control Research Group, I was a Visiting Researcher at the Wellcome Trust Africa Centre for Population Health in South Africa (2013-14), an Honorary Clinical Research Fellow at Oxford Vaccine Group (2010-11) and an Academic Foundation Programme doctor with Oxford Deanery and the Oxford University Clinical Academic Graduate School (2009-11). I will return to London to complete my clinical training in August 2016.
