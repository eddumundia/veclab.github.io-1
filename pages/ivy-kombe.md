<p class="text-justify">
I am a mathematical epidemiologist currently working with statistical models
in data integration within the Viral Epidemiology and Control Group.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
I have a bachelors degree in mathematics and a masters degree in 
epidemiology from the Imperial College London. I am interested in understanding how multiple processes
contribute or converge to singular outcomes.

<p class="text-justify">
My <a href="{{ site.url }}/integrated-data-modelling">PhD project </a> provides an opportunity to study such processes and their application in
interupting disease transmission.
