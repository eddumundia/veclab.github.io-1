<h6>Moses Kiti (BEng, MSc)</h6>
<p class="text-justify">
I joined KEMRI-WTRP in 2009 as a research intern to investigate the spatial and temporal characteristics of the respiratory syncytial virus in Kilifi. In the same year, I  was appointed an Assistant Research Officer to lead studies on human social contact patterns and their importance in the spreading of respiratory infections. I have published two papers on social contact patterns and their impact on vaccination strategies, with a third under review.

<p class="text-justify">
Currently I am a PhD student at the Open University and leading an <a href="{{ site.url }}/social-networks-study"> exciting new study to further understand how people interact in schools, households and the community using wearable proximity sensors and GPS tracking devices </a>. I hope to use this data to design intervention measures such as alternative vaccination plans or social distancing to prevent the spread of respiratory infections.

I hold a Master of Science degree in Demography and Health from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, sponsored through a Wellcome Trust Masters Fellowship, and a Bachelor of Science Degree in Geomatic Engineering and GIS from Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology. I  have also undergone training in human ethics in research, Geodatabase Development in the ArcGIS environment, and I am  proficient in statistical analysis using STATA and R. I am also a member of the John Snow Society.
